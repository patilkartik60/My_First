A Courageous Fool
It is dark. It is raining. Vikrant can’t see anything clearly. There is darkness but has to find a way out of the jungle. All that is visible is a small beacon of light shot upwards in the night sky. Vikrant decides to approach it but he first has to make his way through the dense jungle that is there in his way.
	He sees an opening. He approaches it. With limited vision to work with Vikrant starts moving slowly through the jungle towards the beacon. After a few steps, he hears some noise and follows it and upon inspecting he finds out that there were some people calling his name out, “VIKRANT!.......VIKRANT!”. He gets scared as he doesn’t know these people are. These people will be referred to as ‘Threat NPCs’ throughout the narrative. So he sees them as a threat and his main objective now becomes to not get spotted by them by staying out of their vision and not getting too close to them or making any sudden noise. 
	A feature in this level is added where Vikrant finds random objects which can help him progress through this particular level. He also carries around with him a backpack with limited capacity which he can use to store objects that he finds along the way. 
	First item that he finds is a torch. It’s not a bright torch but it gets the job done. He then uses this torch to find his way through the dense jungle and also to find objects which will help him throughout this particular level. Now as he uses the torch in this level, some objects within the range of the torch light will slightly shine indicating that those are interactable. The user will now be presented with an option to either investigate it or move ahead without any interaction.
	Now as he progresses forward using the torch, he stumbles upon an object which seems familiar to him as he recognizes it to be his missing friend’s wristband. This discovery of his friend’s belongings is one out of many in this level which can also be used as clues to propagate through the mission’s timeline. Upon finding the wristband, he notices a tall figure approaching his direction. All scared and confused, he now faces the problem of getting spotted and jeopardizing his mission. So he now has to avoid getting spotted by the threat NPC and for that the player will be shown a short snippet of a tutorial on how to complete the objective.
	Now that he has found two objects, he stumbles upon the third one. It’s a yoyo. Again, it’s his friend’s. Now the player is again presented with a choice to interact with it or otherwise. Upon interacting, a cutscene will cue taking the player down the memory lane which will make the protagonist recall a common memory of his and his friend’s associated with that particular yoyo.
